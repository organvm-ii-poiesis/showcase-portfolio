      <h2>The Full Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        Aetheria is the project that proves the system works — and honestly reveals where it doesn't. It traveled the complete I→II→III path: from gamification theory to game design to revenue product. This write-up is a post-mortem, because honest reflection on what failed teaches more than polished success stories.
      </p>

      <h2>The Theory (ORGAN-I)</h2>
      <p>
        Not shallow "add points and badges" gamification. Structural gamification — using game <em>design</em> principles to reshape learning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaningful choices</strong> over reward schedules (Deterding's gameful design)</li>
        <li><strong>Recursive pedagogy</strong> — learning is recursive; Level 3 quests require applying Level 2 knowledge in new contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative as motivation</strong> — academic mastery genuinely advances the plot, not as arbitrary overlay</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Game Design (ORGAN-II)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Character system:</strong> Four stats — Insight, Craft, Valor, Empathy — mapping to learning modalities, all growable.
        <strong>Quest design:</strong> Teachers create quests from assignment templates. A reading assignment becomes a "Library Expedition." The RPG framing provides structure that helps teachers design better assignments.
        <strong>World building:</strong> Procedurally generated from curriculum — a chemistry unit generates a world where alchemical principles govern reality.

      <h2>Metrics</h2>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th><th>Assessment</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Pilot classrooms</td><td>47</td><td>Below target (100)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Teacher retention (month 2)</td><td>68%</td><td>Acceptable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Teacher retention (month 6)</td><td>41%</td><td>Below target (60%)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Student engagement increase</td><td>+23%</td><td>Strong</td></tr>
            <tr><td>NPS (teachers)</td><td>42</td><td>Good but not great</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>What Worked</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Student engagement: +23% assignment completion.</strong> Narrative integration was the key — students cared about quest outcomes because the stories were connected to their actual learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The governance pipeline caught quality issues early.</strong> At the I→II transition, we verified the theoretical framework. At II→III, we verified the game design was teacher-ready. Without these gates, we would have shipped too early.
      </p>

      <h2>What Failed</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Onboarding complexity.</strong> 2-3 hours of setup. Teachers don't have that time.
        <strong>Free tier didn't demonstrate value.</strong> Without the narrative engine, it looked like every other gamification tool.
        <strong>Wrong sales direction.</strong> Bottom-up (individual teachers) when value was clearest at school level.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Include a Failure?</h2>
      <p>
        The I→II→III pipeline worked as governance — it caught problems, preserved decisions, and enabled this post-mortem. The product needs iteration, but the system that produced it is sound. That's what governance as creative infrastructure looks like in practice: not preventing failure, but making failure legible and recoverable.
