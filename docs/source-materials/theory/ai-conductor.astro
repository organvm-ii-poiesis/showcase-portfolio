      <h2>The Model</h2>
      <p>
        Every creative team in 2026 is figuring out how to work with AI. Most approaches are "AI replaces human work" or "human ignores AI."<Cite id={1} author="Shneiderman, Ben" title="Human-Centered AI" source="Oxford University Press" year={2022} /> Shneiderman's framework proposes a third path: systems that amplify human capability rather than replacing it. I developed the <strong>AI-conductor model</strong>, where human acts as conductor — setting direction, maintaining quality, making every structural decision — while AI acts as an instrument capable of producing drafts at speed. This isn't "AI wrote my portfolio." It's a designed practice with explicit roles, quality gates, and attribution.<Cite id={2} author="Schön, Donald A." title="The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action" source="Basic Books" year={1983} />

      <h2>How It Works in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Human provides:</strong> Strategic direction, structural decisions, quality criteria, voice and tone, factual accuracy review, final approval.<Cite id={3} author="Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly" title="Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention" source="Harper Perennial" year={1996} /> Csikszentmihalyi's research on creative flow emphasizes that the critical creative act is selection — choosing what to keep, what to discard, what to reshape. The conductor model formalizes this: AI generates options, human selects and refines.

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr><th>Human Role</th><th>AI Role</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>

      <p>
        A typical 3,000-word README: human writes brief → AI generates draft (~15-20K tokens) → human corrects facts, adjusts positioning → AI revises → human approves. Total: ~50-90K tokens, 30-60 minutes human time.<Cite id={4} author="Brooks, Frederick P." title="The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering" source="Addison-Wesley" year={1975} /> Brooks's observation that adding people to a late project makes it later applies inversely here: adding AI to a well-directed project accelerates it, because the communication overhead is zero — the conductor speaks and the instrument responds.

      <h2>The Token Economy</h2>
      <p>
        Effort is measured in LLM API tokens, not human-hours. The bottleneck isn't generation speed — it's review quality.<Cite id={5} author="Kahneman, Daniel" title="Thinking, Fast and Slow" source="Farrar, Straus and Giroux" year={2011} /> Kahneman's distinction between System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking maps directly: AI operates in System 1 mode, producing fluent text rapidly; human review is System 2, catching errors that fluency masks.

      <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Governance.</strong> Every AI-generated document passes through the same promotion state machine as everything else. Specifications, quality gates, validation checklists.<Cite id={7} author="Deming, W. Edwards" title="Out of the Crisis" source="MIT Press" year={1986} /> Deming's principle that quality must be built into the process, not inspected into the product, applies: the conductor model prevents the most common AI failure — plausible text that doesn't say anything useful — by embedding quality checks at every stage.
      </p>

    E --> F{Promotion Gate}
    F -->|Pass| G[DEPLOYED]
    F -->|Fail| H[Revision Queue]
    H --> A`}
      />

      <p>
        <strong>Attribution.</strong> Every document is transparent about its production method. No pretense that a human typed 339K words — and no pretense that AI produced quality work unsupervised.<Cite id={8} author="Floridi, Luciano" title="The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" source="Oxford University Press" year={2023} /> Floridi argues that AI transparency is not merely ethical — it's epistemologically necessary. Readers who know the production method can calibrate their trust appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Artistic intent.</strong> The conductor metaphor is literal. A conductor doesn't play instruments, but the performance is their artistic vision.<Cite id={9} author="Bourdieu, Pierre" title="The Field of Cultural Production" source="Columbia University Press" year={1993} /> Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital applies: the structural decisions — what goes in each document, how documents relate, what to emphasize for which audience — these are human decisions that constitute the creative work. AI is the orchestra.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks We Monitor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hallucinated code examples</strong> — all samples tested or sourced from actual repos</li>
        <li><strong>Generic boilerplate</strong> — project-specific briefs and human review for voice</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect cross-references</strong> — automated link checking (1,267 links audited)<Cite id={10} author="Humble, Jez and David Farley" title="Continuous Delivery" source="Addison-Wesley" year={2010} /></li>
        <li><strong>Missing context</strong> — extensive project context in each prompt + human accuracy review</li>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The eight-organ system is proof that human-AI collaboration produces real output at scale — not blog posts, but governance specifications, technical documentation, and systems architecture.<Cite id={11} author="Licklider, J.C.R." title="Man-Computer Symbiosis" source="IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics" year={1960} /> Licklider's 1960 vision of "man-computer symbiosis" — where humans set goals and computers handle routine processing — is realized here at the scale of an entire institutional system. The methodology is reusable. The quality gates are adaptable. The attribution model is honest. For a creative team evaluating how to integrate AI into practice, this is a working model, not a pitch deck.
      </p>

      <h2>Tradeoffs & Lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Volume vs. voice</strong> — AI generates text quickly, but maintaining a consistent authorial voice across 339K words requires extensive human editing. The conductor metaphor helps: strategic direction is human, execution is AI, but the seams show if review is rushed.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency vs. perception</strong> — Being fully transparent about AI involvement risks the reaction "AI wrote your portfolio." The mitigation is honesty: every essay explains the process, and the quality speaks for itself. Hiding AI involvement would be worse.<Cite id={12} author="Zuboff, Shoshana" title="The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" source="PublicAffairs" year={2019} /></li>
        <li><strong>Quality gates add time</strong> — Template compliance, link checking, and human review add 30-40% overhead to each document. Without them, plausible-sounding text masks factual errors and inconsistencies. The overhead is the cost of trustworthy output.</li>
        <li><strong>Token economics</strong> — At ~6.5M total tokens, the system cost is non-trivial. But compared to the human-hours equivalent of writing 339K words from scratch (estimated 1,700+ hours at 200 words/hour), the conductor model is dramatically more efficient.</li>
      </ul>
