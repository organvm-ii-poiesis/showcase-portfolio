      <h2>The Community Organ</h2>
      <p>
        Most creative systems treat community as an audience — people who consume the work. ORGAN VI (Koinonia) treats community as infrastructure: the relational substrate that makes sustained creative work possible. The community organ doesn't produce content; it produces the conditions under which content-producers flourish. This is the organ that prevents the eight-organ system from becoming a solitary monument — it's the part that connects to other minds.
      </p>

      <h2>Salon Archive</h2>
      <p>
        The salon archive is a curated collection of facilitated intellectual conversations — structured dialogues on topics spanning epistemology, systems design, generative art, and institutional governance. Each salon has a theme, invited participants, a facilitator's guide, and a post-session synthesis. The format draws on the historical tradition of intellectual salons (Gertrude Stein's Paris gatherings, the Vienna Circle) adapted for distributed, asynchronous participation. Salons are invitation-only and the archive is maintained privately to protect participant candor.
      </p>

      <h2>Reading Group Curriculum</h2>
      <p>
        The reading group curriculum provides structured pathways through the intellectual foundations of the eight-organ system. Each curriculum maps a 6&ndash;12 week arc through primary texts, connecting theoretical frameworks (Bateson's cybernetics, Luhmann's systems theory, Haraway's situated knowledges) to concrete implementation decisions in the organ system. The reading groups aren't book clubs — they're collaborative sense-making sessions where participants trace how abstract theory becomes architectural choice.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Community Infrastructure Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The eight-organ system can be read as a solo practitioner's portfolio, and it works at that level. But the community organ represents an ambition beyond individual craft: building the relational infrastructure for a creative institution. Salons create feedback loops between the system's theory and external perspectives. Reading groups train collaborators in the system's intellectual foundations. Together, they transform a portfolio into a practice — something that can survive beyond a single person's attention span. Community infrastructure is the organ that makes the system reproducible.
