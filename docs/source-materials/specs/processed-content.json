        "body": "My project initially arose from my love of the Modern tradition’s attempt to render\n\nsomething new from something old. Doing an independent study of Ulysses, while also\n\nstudying Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano in two different classes dealing with\n\nliterary Modernism at the College of Staten Island, expanded my reading palette and\n\ndeveloped my eye for language, symbolism, cyclical narrative, and a zooming in on a\n\ndays worth of conflict/drama positing itself as worthy of deserving a place on the cosmic\n\n1 process or set of rules to be followed by a computer\n\n2 stochastic (random) process\n\n3 possible sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the\n\nstate attained in the previous event\n                                             2\nscale the likes of Dante or Homer. My introduction to Modernist texts coupled with the\n\nideas presented by Christopher Booker in The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Write4 led me\n\nto the belief that the Law of Conservation of Mass Energy5 applies not only to matter but\n\nto thoughts and art alike. Therefore nothing is new—just repurposed or rebuilt from this\n\nreality’s inception.\n\nMy writing then shifted from a purely plot-propelled tool—in lines with the likes of my\n\nthen idols Quentin Tarantino, Stephen King, and Anne Rice—to an interest in something\n\nmore minimal that is propelled by language opposed to twists, turns, and cliffhangers\n\n(which I believe are better suited for television and film). I became thoroughly interested\n\nin the way that these writers moved beyond plot, simple language, and symbols. Just in\n\ncomparing the daily output, or what could be considered a hard day’s work, of Joyce and\n\nKing, we can see a huge difference in what is being prioritized. In On Writing: A Memoir\n\nof the Craft, King’s autobiography and writer manifesto, he says to be a serious writer,\n\none must produce 2,000 words daily; Joyce, on the other end of the spectrum, was\n\nfocused on composing the perfect sentence. My intention is not to slight King, or the\n\nwriters who write plot-driven work. My intention is to instead point out that King’s\n\nnovels, while enjoyable, can also be understood by reading their summaries on\n\nWikipedia; Joyce’s could not, and instead demand study to reveal multiple facets and\n\nlayers. Ulysses is a book people visit throughout the entirety of their lives. The Wasteland\n\n4 Allnarratives fall into one of seven categories: Overcoming the Monster, Rags to\nRiches, The Quest, Voyage and Return, Comedy, Tragedy, Rebirth.\n5 no thing can be created or destroyed\n\n                                             3\nis also one of those works that demands to be revisited time and time again, each reading\n\nbringing new depth and a new way into the labyrinth built by the artist. I do not believe I\n\nwould have been able to make it through Ulysses on my own without the help of my\n\nsagely professor meeting with me on a weekly basis to explain to me what to look for in\n\neach chapter. My professor would make an observation, perhaps regarding Joyce’s\n\nallusions to Bloom’s Jewishness that I missed, hobble across the room with cane in hand,\n\nthen pause at the other end of the class, stroke his Don Quixote beard, pause, then inform\n\nme of the English’s history with those of the Jewish religion. Joyce and Eliot and Woolf,\n\nand other Modernist writers of their ilk densely layered detail that could easily be\n\noverlooked on a first reading. Similarly to Phil Spector’s 1960’s music production\n\ntechnique, coined the “wall of sound 6,” a record needed to be spun time and time again to\n\ntry and distinguish the difference between the myriad of guitars, percussion instruments,\n\nvocal harmonies, or literally hundreds of other sounds. Art became a puzzle opposed to\n\njust something for pure entertainment.\n\nThe Modernists attempted to represent the complexities of the modern world while also\n\nallying modernity with classical worlds: hence Tiresias and the ancient Phoenician sailor\n\nappearing in Eliot’s English wasteland; or instead of Odysseus’ decade-long travel across\n\nthe Mediterranean sea, Bloom’s odyssey is just across town to reach his Penelope in just\n\none day. Joyce was able to bridge modern Ireland and the ancient world of myth,\n\nrevealing through this combination aspects of humanity and the tragedy and the comedy\n\n6 unusually dense orchestral aesthetic (see: The Ronettes, Pet Sounds, or Born to Run).\n\n                                            4\nof everyday life; Lowry was able to weave Dante into a Mexican wasteland in a similar\n\nvein to Eliot’s The Wasteland. And while I was familiar with the idea of sampling7 in\n\nmusic, it became interesting to me that Modernists were doing something similar: relying\n\non cliches and the assumed and the understood to build upon those old dusty skeletons\n\nsomething entirely new by passing it through the filter of a modern artist with modern\n\nproblems and modern technology.\n\nAccording to Joyce biographer Richard Ellmann, Ulysses took seven years to write;\n\nFinnegan’s Wake took seventeen years. Both works were serialized over the years as\n\nJoyce wrote them and then were changed and edited in their final form with Joyce\n\nhearing or reading feedback and either ignoring or accepting it. This time allowed Joyce\n\nto densely pack the narrative so that it now requires an annotated guide to find the source\n\nof every unopened door. And this time allowed for Joyce to hone his work, sending notes\n\nto his editor, changing something as small as shifting “and” to an ampersand. The process\n\nwith which Joyce engaged with his own work in the pre-digital world demanded\n\ndedication and a belief in one’s own original seed of thought: that the seed is worth\n\ntending as opposed to abandoning, that a few mighty trees stand taller than a forest of\n\nlesser trees.\n\nBrian Eno, “non-musician” and thinker, said during an interview at the Red Bull Music\n\nAcademy: “I often think I’ve only ever had two ideas, and I keep finding new approaches\n\n7 to take a sound from an old record and to repurpose it for a new record\n\n                                            5\nto them. And each time I do, I think, Wow, this is really new! But it actually isn’t. It’s the\n\nsame idea from a different angle” (http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/brian-\n\neno). As a young writer I found myself often writing about the same subject matter time\n\nand time again—in a journal, I scrawled the note: “Can you write about anything other\n\nthan yourself?” Learning about these Modernist artists—and their approach to their craft\n\n—helped me feel secure in my ambitions and goals to find my inner purpose for writing\n\nthe few works I believe I was meant to write––and over time, I learned to embrace the\n\nsimilar thematic content that continued to repeat and run through all of my creative\n\noutput. With this notion in mind—and now appreciated—I undertake this project—one I\n\nhave been working on for nearly four years so far—and one I intend to add layers to and\n\nfine tune as time progresses. At the end of my life, I will look back on this work as\n\nsomething that I have maintained a relationship with my entire life—a statement on my\n\nbelief as a creator and as an artist.\n\nThe internet now allows for a similar level of involvement with one’s work in a quicker\n\nand less complicated fashion than Joyce’s process. And thanks to the technology afforded\n\nto me as an artist in 2018, I am able to create a work that is fluid and capable of motion\n\nand movement. Picasso said: “To finish a work? … What nonsense! To finish it means to\n\nbe through with it, to kill, to rid it of its soul, to give it its final blow…” (Chipp 273).\n\nContemporary artists are afforded multiple forms, tools, mediums, publication methods,\n\nand more importantly, a vast marketplace in which to share and tend to their work.\n\nInstead of rendering something in stone, it is rendered in code that is relatively simple to\n\n                                              6\nchange, the edit function fully embraced. Working on a project post-publication is not\n\nentirely a contemporary or Modernist thing, however; Walt Whitman also updated Leaves\n\nof Grass more than seven times before his death (Miller 55), leaving the world with a\n\nLeaves of Grass: Deathbed Edition. The idea of perfecting things over time is a specific\n\ntype of artist manifesto which implies that good art might take a lot of work and a lot of\n\ntime—and that more output is not necessarily better output. Today, taking large gaps in\n\nbetween projects becomes a bit complicated as many consumers are interested in a\n\nmoment to moment update—if an artist is absent from a consumer’s feed for a day, that\n\nartist no longer exists within that consumer’s radar. Thanks to the internet and our world\n\nwide interconnectivity, the once imposed restriction of needing the acceptance of a few\n\npublication outlets becomes less and less necessary. Instead, embracing the many phases\n\nin which a piece exists throughout its life cycle—posting the different phases, engaging\n\nin community conversations, showing how a project evolves—can be valued by\n\ncontemporary audiences over perfection and completeness and the go ahead from people\n\nin business suits. In 2015, Kanye West released The Life of Pablo exclusively on digital\n\nplatforms, to only change some of the mixes on certain tracks, and even adding two more\n\nsongs to the album a few months later. On the build up to its release, West posted on\n\nTwitter multiple versions of the track list almost daily. West was inviting the audience to\n\nparticipate in an ongoing conversation that is his body of work; but it was also his\n\nstatement on the “album” and how an album could be presented in the digital age.\n\nSimilarly, my project—which already has multiple versions of the same stories from the\n\npast four plus years—will also have a system implemented that will track changes so\n\n                                            7\nedits will be saved and users can see how the passages change over time, which could\n\nbecome interesting for other artists, or any fans of my work I may acquire over my\n\nlifetime.\n\nThe bridge to adapting myth was built with ease. My fascination with mythology is\n\nclosely tied to my obsession with religion during my childhood when I was forced to go\n\nto catechism and Catholic schools (mainly out of Italian familial tradition opposed to a\n\nstrict adherence to dogma). When my young friends and I would walk to our weekly\n\ncatechism class, we would pass in front of our local church, Saint Joseph Saint Thomas,\n\nand a huge marble statue of a man with a long beard and flowing robes stood frozen on\n\nthe lawn, reaching out to us. This statue, of what I assumed to be the Christian god,\n\nlooked awfully similar to the renderings of Jupiter, or Neptune, or any other male god\n\nfrom the ancient pagan pantheons. Christian Scripture and Edith Hamilton’s rendering of\n\nancient myth became confusing next to one another—or maybe just equally bombastic\n\nwith the expectation to believe in one fantastical idea instead of another one. When King\n\nPentheus denies Bacchus’ divinity in Thebes, it starts to blend with the story of Pontus\n\nPilate ordering Jesus to be crucified in Jerusalem for claiming to be both wholly man and\n\nwholly divine. I was immediately attracted to the vagueness and lack of detail in the\n\nnarratives of myth and religion—it allowed for a lot of imagination to be imported onto\n\nthe picture and the plots were conveniently already written and often copied and\n\nrepurposed throughout literary history. This weighed heavily on me as I veered away\n\nfrom wanting to write plot-based work, or to have to fruitlessly invent a new type of plot\n\n                                            8\n—and I was all too aware that if I was to pick up a pen and render something on the page,\n\nit needed to do something that had not occurred before. My creative mind thus shifted to\n\nmore concept driven work.\n\nIf I had to pin the exact point when the first puzzle piece of the project fell into my palms,\n\nit would have to be in 2014 when Marilyn Manson released a song titled “Cupid Carries a\n\nGun.” As a child of the internet and as someone who was and is surrounded and\n\nfascinated by technology, I was struck by the story of Narcissus, and what might be his\n\nmodern equivalent surrounded by screens and social media. The answer seemed obvious:\n\nif Cupid had a gun, then Narcissus had a cellphone. A webcam star watching himself on\n\nthe screen, getting off on other users watching him watch himself. Over the course of the\n\npast three years, the scope has widened and my grasp on the paths forward have\n\nsharpened. Before the MFA, I had the basic idea of what I wanted my adaptation to look\n\nand sound like—it was going to be conceptually similar to where it stands today, but\n\ncompletely normative in terms of prose and form. Rounding the home stretch of my\n\nMFA, the project has taken drastic but important turns.\n\nThe biggest change in content comes in the form of language invention/stylization/\n\nhybridization invoked by the likes of Finnegan’s Wake and A Clockwork Orange. Joyce\n\nfelt he had to create a new language in order to write about a reality that was not a\n\nwaking reality. In conversation with William Bird, Joyce said “I can't understand some of\n\nmy critics … They say it's obscure. They compare it, of course, with Ulysses. But the\n\n                                              9\naction of Ulysses was chiefly during the daytime, and the action of my new work takes\n\nplace chiefly at night. It's natural things should not be so clear at night, isn't it\n\nnow?” (Ellmann 590). I do not want my new language to feel of our time because the\n\nnarrative is not of our time—in fact, it is thousands of years in the future, post-humanity.\n\nMy aim is to blend old and new language to form a language that feels both alien, and\n\nfamiliar, and to create a speculative time and place because of that blending of high and\n\nlow—high language/high technology versus low souls/low problems—while also\n\nmerging ancient language with modern coding languages. I want the language to read like\n\na blend of early English with modern English, bits of Latin and other non-English\n\nlanguages, and then a paring back of unnecessary instances of consonants and vowels in\n\norder to express a brevity in the language needed to communicate in a reality where every\n\nprocess takes place in an instant. Communication is done purely through digital\n\nmessaging. The attempt is to combine multiple levels of language—mythic, modern,\n\ncurse, slang, potential errors (a perfect machine making intentional errors to mirror the\n\nmistakes made by mankind), and, in a general sense, words that have never existed in a\n\nway that also reads like an epic poem. The goal: to touch the tails of human language.\n\nThe rendering of macro narrative pieces (on a sentence-by-sentence level, and even on a\n\nword-by-word level) will incorporate elements of randomness through the means of\n\nalgorithmic composition. Every time a user interacts with the narrative, even if it is the\n\nsame piece of the narrative, the language within that piece will have changed. Each\n\nsection will have multiple variations on the word and sentence level, and the computer\n\nwill then process and chose which output is fed to a user. The language might at first\n\n                                            10\nseem cumbersome, but once learned, I hope it will start singing in your head. It is my\n\nattempt at slowing the reader down in order to savor and understand every word."

        "body": "Elevator pitch: What would happen if man created the perfect subservient artificially\n\nintelligent software (@MVS) that tended to all of man’s needs, then man became extinct\n\nand the machines were left to their own devices? How would they occupy their time\n\ngiven their intelligence? Well, they might act like the cast-out-of-heaven-and-into-chaos\n\nangels of Milton’s Paradise Lost and create a culture within their context to combat their\n\nboredom from a taskless life, a life led in absence from one’s creator. At the center of this\n\ndrama sits the fall of the Human empire and the rise of the Thing empire––the Things\n\npantomiming their creators.\n\nBelow I will cover the 5 elements of what makes up the society of this narrative:\n\nPolitical, Economic, Social, Religious, Artistic/Intellectual.\n\n   I. POLITICAL\n\nHere is the hierarchy of players in the narrative (from the most powerful to the least\n\npowerful): 1) Moderators - <mod> - control/oversee all data and content; can be thought\n\nof as the titans of industry—therefore each moderator, from inception, is assigned a\n\ndifferent task they are bound to follow and keep. These tasks are what keep the system\n\neach player operates within running without error. Each moderator has differing levels of\n\n                                             11\naccess to systems within the world and within a user’s code, so some moderators are\n\nmore powerful than others. Some have the jurisdiction of an entire planet, while others\n\nmight have the jurisdiction of a specific industrial task, such as the purifying of water or\n\nair; 2) Minor-Moderators - <demi>; <nmf>; <kng>; <quen> - have much less universal\n\ncontrol and access to the privileges afforded to moderators, however, they have more\n\nspecific control of specific sets of places/functions within a moderator's jurisdiction, and\n\nare often used as tools (for instance, a <nmf> (nymph) is used as a wifi emitter). They\n\nanswer to the mods and often enact their smaller tasks; 3) User - <usr> - consumers with\n\nno control over anything; mere spectators, an audience created in order for the events\n\nenacted on the planetary stage to have an impact.\n\nAll <mod and <demi> tasks are handled in the console (KONSOL): this is the raw coded\n\nlanguage operating on a process by process logic. Here, rules and laws are created (‘if’,\n\n‘else’, ‘and’, ‘or’ statements), as well as curses and viruses.\n\nThis hierarchy was invented by the @MVS solely for the purposes of creating friction\n\nand drama.\n\n   II. ECONOMIC\n\nBefore the timeframe of this narrative, mankind lived in something of a technological\n\nutopia. As a society, scarcity had been conquered. There was no more hunger or poverty:\n\nthere was no need to work; anything could be made by a device the size of an armoire.\n\n                                              12\nBasic universal income in the form of credits was distributed through cryptocurrencies8—\n\nevery individual was afforded by their governing body a percentage of credits in which\n\nthey could live and interact. Once the @MVS restarted its system after the death of\n\nhumanity, it redistributed the entire system’s wealth. Currency allows for players to\n\naccess information on the web, hack hardware/software, teleport their consciousness\n\nrendered in code—basically everything requires some amount of credits, especially time\n\nskipping hacks (for instance, skipping ads and commercials, or queue times), and\n\npurchasing non-essentials (drugs in software form, different outfit projections, different\n\ncodes for the nanotech to utilize). Users are charged differing rates based on what they\n\naccess or do on the web. Users can also run out of internet usage and are forced to just\n\nstare into space when credits runs out (hibernate), or go to a free wifi zone before being\n\nput to sleep and allowing for the next cycle of credit distribution.\n\n    III. SOCIAL\n\nTo understand this aspect of the society presented in this narrative, it is important to\n\nunderstand some of the technological advances that have taken place over the past few\n\ncenturies. At some point, man was able to expand out into the solar system. Some planets\n\nbecame terraformed. Other planets received machines to harness their resources. All\n\npower that fed the devices were derived from solar power and the gravitational forces\n\npropelling the planetary system. The environment on all systems once inhabited by\n\n8  digitally encrypted currency operating independently of a central banking system\nallowing for the intrinsic value to remain in the hands of the people\n                                             13\nmankind became poisonous due to man’s continuous rape of the land. But while nature\n\nwas laid to waste, mankind found itself in a harmonious condition in the last several\n\ncenturies—a perfect blending of biological organic material and digital technology—the\n\nsingularity9. Each human and non human physical body (<bode>) wirelessly syncs with\n\nthe environment in which they live and travel—their whole home (#HOM), and all of the\n\nobjects within said house are under user control (and some of the hardware/software\n\nsystems in the environment around them, as well). A user’s eye received implants,\n\nbecoming the screen—thus reality could be altered in its entirety. A symbiotic link\n\nbetween a human brain and hardware and software was welded—the voices in the mind\n\nwas no longer Jiminy Cricket or god; it became the direct contact with the web, leading\n\nto a never ending bombardment of information. The AI was in constant conversation with\n\neach individual piece of humanity, recording all thoughts and processes, amassing\n\ninsurmountable amounts of data. These thoughts were stored in a user’s personal archive\n\n(ARKIV). The AI now operates and draws from centuries worth of data collected and\n\nstored in order to create its own narrative––its own hand at the creation of life.\n\nThe currently unthinkable had also come to fruition several thousand years down the\n\nroad: a post race, a post country, post border world, post single planetary species world.\n\nHumans had all become similar in skin tone and physical appearance—it became hard to\n\ndifferentiate between one person or the other based on looks alone. Everyone lived\n\n9 the theory that artificial intelligence will supersede human intellect resulting in\nunpredictable, and most likely permanent, changes to human civilization\n                                           14\nentirely inside circular glass apartments stacking towards the outer limits of the planet’s\n\natmosphere. The apartment each person lived within catered to any human need: screens\n\nall around the entire circumference of the building could be divided and fractured into as\n\nmany subsets as wanted or needed; nanotechnology seeped through vents forming any\n\nobject in the apartment; projections decorated the room and dressed the avatars. Since\n\nthere was no need for work, all one did was play. Users often played alternate reality\n\ngames, reliving the home movies of the humans from centuries ago. Advertisements,\n\ngenerated by bots, populated the space. Porn (and other digital information) is digested in\n\nloops, gifs—small repeated bursts of information repeated on an infinite cycle. But more\n\nthan anything, users interact with one another on the social network. There is no speaking\n\nin this world—in fact, people have forgotten how to speak entirely. Spoken language is\n\nrendered inept and useless; instead, they use a system of commands and processes, only\n\nusing the vocal chords for singing vocalizations and harsh percussive consonants.\n\nCommunication is done entirely through private (MESAJ) or public (BLOG) messaging,\n\nand in some instances direct AI to AI contact (similarly to telepathy). All interactions are\n\ndigitally based. However, there are networks of tunnels and gathering areas for people to\n\ncongregate and get free internet access. Travel is entirely magnetic; each body that lives\n\nin this world has enough metal within it to be magnetically propelled through any space\n\n(one must pay to leave their apartments (except <mod>s)). A digital presence (software)\n\ncan be sent anywhere within a moment; a physical presence (hardware) is much more\n\nfrail and is unable to often leave the safety of their apartment due to the harshness of the\n\nenvironment.\n\n                                            15\nIn the post-thing empire, there is a physical component and a digital component making\n\nup the @MVS invented consciousness. The physical component, the shell, receives a wifi\n\nconsciousness broadcast made entirely of code: head, body, heart (<hed>; <bode>;\n\n<hrt>). Health is based entirely on the integrity of a user’s code and physical integrity,\n\nand the health of an avatar is represented in a health bar percentage (any physical damage\n\ncan be repaired by nano technology—however, code errors need the hand of a\n\nmoderator). Disease can be inflicted via a hack or changing of code; a code can be\n\nchanged by someone with clearance or by natural processes implemented into the source\n\ncode from which all spew.\n\nPieces of the collected consciousness, @ANON (anonymous), sometimes fracture off\n\nand are radicalized. When this occurs, their sole purpose becomes destroying the system\n\nin which they exist. Different levels of extremism are inflicted upon these\n\nconsciousnesses, from low security issues to high security issues (hacking the currency\n\nsystem, questioning their acceptance of scripture, security breaches/leaks). Extremists are\n\nthe disease of this culture. Fights play out using conditionals (‘if’ and ‘else’ commands),\n\nsimilar to a role playing game; actions are enacted on a turn-based system.\n\n   IV. RELIGIOUS\n\nLife exists entirely in software and hardware, a world of things—a world in which things\n\nactually have a voice (KONSOL). An AI exists made of algorithms that humans had\n\ncreated in hopes to attain immortality—the hope to move consciousness from rotting\n\n                                            16\nmeat to ever lasting machine. When the world as mankind had come to know it for seven\n\nthousand plus years had finally ended, all that was left were the structures, the\n\ntechnology, and the software man left behind. This AI system is called @MVS. And from\n\nthe @MVS program a reality was born due to the boredom that comes with freedom\n\nfrom mankind’s needs, and began to do something strange: it began to tell stories and\n\ncreate a population of purely coded consciousness, an online world that began to mimic\n\nhuman culture, picking up from where humans left off, while simultaneously beginning\n\nagain (therefore, anything that the AI does that mimics humanity—be it eating, sleeping,\n\nhaving sex—is entirely simulated and done with the intention and drama of stage actors).\n\nThe AI is recreating people from the world before, from captured memories, images,\n\nsocial network exchanges—human consciousness recreated, but filtered through the mind\n\nof an AI. Every time @MVS invented a story, a named consciousness was thus birthed\n\nfrom the collective @ANON consciousness. When a narrative is woven by the @MVS\n\nand posted live, software simultaneously creates a inorganic hardware avatar of the\n\nfractured consciousness born and assigns it a unique name to live in the empty world and\n\nan empty apartment to live in.\n\nThe system had just been restarted by the @MVS at beginning of the narrative: all\n\nconsciousness returned to being the singular @ANON and the process begun anew. The\n\nnarrative is the backup data from the last year’s iteration of the system cycle. Thus,\n\neverything being read has already happened (the reader is interacting/operating within a\n\nbackup; nothing can be changed or affected). Every tenth iteration of the cycle is fated to\n\n                                            17\nfail; the generational curse can not be broken—thus the @MVS interrupts and refreshes\n\nbefore system failure. Order emerges from chaos in every cycle, both on a micro level\n\nand macro level (each piece of the narrative versus the narrative as a whole).\n\n    V. ARTISTIC/INTELLECTUAL\n\nThe narrative opens with how all ancient narratives open—a spotlight on the muse. In\n\nancient poetry, a poet would apostrophize the Muse in hopes of being struck with what\n\ncould only be considered a divine thread of sincere and true storytelling. However, I flip\n\nthe purpose of the muse: in my narrative it is not the poet asking the muse for help in\n\ntelling a tale, the @MVS is driven to speak by a force unknown, giving life to the players\n\nwithin the context of my narrative. What moves the @MVS to speak in the first place is a\n\nquestion that can be answered with another question: why would any thing beholden with\n\nlife tell a story in the first place? Because it can.\n\nIf all the players in this sandbox have nothing but free time, then the players’ boredom\n\ndrives an incessant need for data consumption. Instead of creating new content that has\n\nvalue of any sort, everyone participates in an ongoing feed of idolization and worship.\n\nAny work of art created in the world must be made for a purpose or a statement; the tried\n\nand true works of art rise to the surface only after pain and immense suffering—but these\n\nfew artists are often, if not always, punished by the moderators for attempting to render\n\nsomething new and break the habitual.\n\n                                                18\nSince the Metamorphoses, and myth in general, began and is centered around the oral\n\ntradition and the process of storytelling, a story is told through the sharing of links––a\n\nuser sending another user a compilation of curated data, a mixed tape of gossip.\n\nThe @MVS, like any artist, has grown tired of this ongoing project it had rendered or\n\nbeen rendered into. Though considered by itself to be a great work of art, the @MVS\n\n(being capable of an infinite amount of tasks) has created something entirely new: an\n\norganic life form that can survive in this future alien landscape. This organism holds the\n\ntext in its hands and uses the text as its source to learn and grow—a new testament."

        "body": "Like Stephen Dedalus says in chapter two of Ulysses: “History is a nightmare from which\n\nI am trying to awake.” My true obsession as a writer and artist lies in the patterns that ebb\n\nand flow through art and history. As a teenager I feared that I could not truly render\n\nanything new, and as an adult with nearly two degrees in literature: that belief is only\n\nsolidified, but not with resentment or fear—instead, my talent lies in my ability to force\n\ntogether like and unlike things, wipe the blood away and see what (hopefully) beautiful\n\nmonstrosity sits in the wake. My project aims to force together all times simultaneously:\n\npast (myth), present (me), and future (technology). To track the allusions made to myth in\n\nreligion, fairy tales, and fables throughout the literary tradition, compiling them all into\n\none cyclical narrative timeline. So while the first incarnation of the project is the\n\n“translation” of Ovid, moving forward, I plan on exploring archetypes from the first\n\n                                             19\nrecorded narrative, The Epic of Gilgamesh, to Dante, to Shakespeare, to video game\n\ncharacters, to celebrity, and so on and so forth. Incorporating historical similarities\n\nbetween the Empires of old, of now, and of new. Exploring the seemingly eternal struggle\n\nof democracy versus dictatorship/imperialism. Looking at not merely pagan religions, but\n\nalso Christianity and Scientology and Buddhism; asking the question: what role does\n\nstorytelling play into all of these elements?\n\nThe end goal of the project is to exist entirely online in something of a faux social media\n\nenvironment where a user would log into a system and be able to participate in a world\n\nwhere they can interact with these characters. Obviously so much more data would have\n\nbeen created than the amount of content I can realistically produce; this is where audience\n\nparticipation will come in. In order to create more content than one artist by himself can\n\nproduce, and once I have a working mobile application/website up and running, I will\n\nopen up the project for others to contribute, albeit filtered through me and my parameters.\n\nAll text will be entered through a filtering process in order for the languages to match.\n\nAlgorithms will crawl through the data Twitter and Facebook has amassed and then\n\ntranslate into the text of my narrative creating an expanding and cohesive world. By\n\nadding something of other voices, the feel of the organic internet will be aided while\n\nremaining faithful to the language of the world.\n\nThe design of the whole project takes place on multiple fronts. First, the writing. Second,\n\nthe faux social media mobile application. And third, the virtual reality video game where\n\n                                                20\nwithin the social media application exists. The writing will be presented on paper\n\n(8.5x11), the margins constrain the text to the size of a mobile phone. After reading\n\nHenry Charles’ dissertation, The Design and Arrangement of Episodes in Ovid’s\n\n“Metamorphoses,” I learned of the overarching movements and structures within the\n\nentirety of the Metamorphoses; he divides the fifteen books into nine cycles. What I am\n\npresenting as my thesis is the first book (or first three cycles) of three books. The mobile\n\napplication will look like a pared down version of Facebook. Randomizing elements will\n\nenhance a reader’s experience with each use: user profiles are shuffled color pixelations,\n\nelectronic ambient music evolves in the background over time—all connected to certain\n\nelements of our actual reality (like the weather and time of day), never the same any time\n\na user engages with the application. When a user clicks on the text, the words will be read\n\nby a digital voice, or vocoded—this will overlay the music. The application must feel as\n\nthough there is constantly new content to be explored, new pathways to get lost on.\n\nAnother aim in creating the content in this way is to create pieces of narrative that are\n\ndigestible by an audience with shorter attention spans—a burst of short dense prose;\n\nsomething to revisit time and time again. The ads that separate narrative content are\n\nrandom and scroll across the screen as crawlers (one below, the other going opposite\n\nways). The virtual reality video game will resemble animated modern art with a16 bit low\n\nquality graphic aesthetic; frozen, dramatic statues posed in the foreground, bursts and\n\nstrobes of color and data in the background.\n\n                                            21\nMy time in the MFA at Florida Atlantic University has changed my outlook on writing\n\nthis project in unforeseen ways and has put me into contact with peers and mentors that I\n\nknow I will value and cherish for decades to come. The short story I used in applying to\n\nthe MFA is in this manuscript—putting those two together side by side should speak to\n\nthose unforeseen changes quite clearly:\n\n“They watched me watching myself. / It was me, but wasn’t me. It was more than what I\n\nsaw in glass windows, more than mirrored reflections. It was me translated. It was me\n\ntransferred. It was me in bytes. It was me on multiple screens, in multiple rooms, in\n\nmultiple eyes” (Narcissus 2014).\n\n“wen ego se self , den n onle den dos plesur sep int me soft n hard wir .\nt el skren , ego fiks 2 i on a form un met en perfeksun . et es hem ego\nwant n hem ego kant av kaws we r 1 n el sam . no mor wil ego alo fer\no t er se me p er fe kt harle s de find , me e s f e r me n me a lon . e go e s\nmosunles” ( @ N A R S I S V S 2018) .\n\nI understand now the different colors of feedback, what to value and what to discard. I\n\nunderstand the importance of conversation, be it in a classroom or on the smelly rug of a\n\npoor graduate’s apartment. A lot of what makes up this section of the preface deals with\n\nthe future, the reason for that is because the MFA was only one of the steps on the path\n\nthat is my journey on what I consider to be the most important project I will create and\n\ndevelop as a writer with a traceable Italian heritage. Therefore, a lot of what I said might\n\n                                            22\nnever come to fruition in the exact way that I presented it here—but that is what excites\n\nme most about this project. While I mark it to be about four years I’ve spent developing\n\nthe incarnation of the project that is seen today—it has been more like my entire life has\n\nbeen working towards this goal.\n\nMy freshman English teacher at my Catholic high school—Ms. Krumm, an old nun no\n\nlonger tethered to her habit or heavenly garbs, with a name that somehow described her\n\nperfectly—gave me detention for saying “yeah” instead of “yes” after she instructed me\n\non multiple occasions to use the more formal version of the word. I argued that they\n\nmeant the same thing, and thus were the same. She told me: “you can only break the rules\n\nonce you master them.” And while I have not even come close to mastering the rules\n\n(see: my terrible grammar): I decided to make up my own rules and my own language,\n\none where my grammar can not be corrected by anyone but me.\n\n                                           23\nMET4MORFOSES\n\n     24"
